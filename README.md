# HOI4 ULTRA Project
 Github Repository for the HOI4 ULTRA Project.

For good practice:
- Make sure to use the One Drive for any additional non-mod files (so excel, historical pdf sources, etc.). You can access it here https://1drv.ms/u/s!AnSI6cCKtqT8g-g5Hru_2F6b5f9i9A?e=NCzE6X
- For tracking changes/issues I suggest using the issues function to record new bugs, todos or whatevers - as it gives us a better way to know who's doing what (you can add subtasks, assign it to people, associate with a larger project, add tags (like bugfixes) and so on.
- When contributing please record changes made so everybody knows what was changed when. Helps us in the scenario that perhaps a new bug was introduced/keeps others informed.
